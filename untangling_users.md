## other users
With no arguments, su will start a root shell (after authenticating with root's password). However, you can also give a username as an argument to switch to that user instead of root.

## cracking passwords 
When you enter a password for su, it compares it against the stored password for that user. These passwords used to be stored in /etc/passwd, but because /etc/passwd is a globally-readable file, this is not good for passwords, these were moved to /etc/shadow.

## using sudo
Also unlike su, rather than authenticating via password, sudo relies on policies that it checks to determine the user's authorization run things as root. These policies are defined in /etc/sudoers.
